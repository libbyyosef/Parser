# Parser
Welcome to the Java Code Parser library! This repository provides a comprehensive Java library for parsing and validating Java code files. The library is structured into distinct packages, each dedicated to handling specific aspects of code parsing, such as conditions, methods, and variables.

**Key Features**

- **Robust Exception Handling:** The library employs a systematic approach to exception handling, with specific exception classes for different error scenarios. This allows for easy identification of the origin of errors during debugging, enhancing the overall code quality.
- **Organized Package Structure:** The code follows the Package by Feature or Layer design pattern, ensuring a well-organized and easily maintainable codebase. Each package focuses on a specific functionality, streamlining the development and maintenance process.
- **Regular Expressions (Regex) Integration:** The library leverages Regex through the CommonPatterns class, which provides constants representing common regular expressions. This integration enhances the efficiency of pattern matching and validation throughout the parsing process.
- **Information Hiding for Clarity:** Private classes and methods are strategically employed to encapsulate specific exceptions and implementation details. This follows the principle of information hiding, exposing only essential public interfaces for enhanced readability.
- **Code Reusability:** To minimize redundancy, the library encapsulates certain parsing components, such as condition parsing and parameter parsing, into dedicated classes. This promotes modular and reusable code practices.

**Package Structure**
- **Package: conditions**

- Handles parsing and validation of condition statements, utilizing Regex patterns for accuracy.
**Package: main**
  
- Manages the main parsing process, integrating Regex for various pattern validations.
**Package: methods**

- Focuses on the parsing and validation of method-related elements, including method calls, signatures, and parameters.
**Package: variables**

- Manages the parsing and validation of variable-related elements, including declarations, assignments, and scopes.
  
**Implementation Highlights**

**Regex Integration**
- The CommonPatterns class provides a set of constants representing Regex patterns for different types of patterns. These patterns are utilized across the program for parsing and validating input, such as variable names and types, method names, and condition statements.
**Exception Handling**
- For each possible error, specific exception classes are created to facilitate detailed error tracking during debugging. A common ParserException class serves as the base for all parsing-related exceptions.
**Design Patterns**
- **Static Utility:** The CommonPatterns class follows the Static Utility design pattern, providing a centralized source for commonly used Regex patterns.
- **Facade:** Classes like VariableParser, VariableScope, and VariableVerifier act as facades, simplifying interactions with underlying functionality.
- **Iterator:** ImageIterator and ImageIterableProperty implement the Iterator pattern for seamless traversal of pixels in image-related functionalities.
